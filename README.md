# P1-G7-Literacy-Lane

## Description

Our motivation was to create a “one stop shop” for users to overcome any kind of struggles with literacy or pronunciation. Literacy Lane is a simple learning site for anyone learning English. You will have access to resources guiding you through reading strategies and interactive learning with the ability to generate words with content. Click "Start Learning" to go down Literacy Lane and begin your education today! We built this project initially because our group member Jasmina is a teacher and has noticed the need for more outlets for reading comprehension and pronunciation practice. We are aiming to amend this decline in literacy education(especially after the Pandemic) which is supported by official studies like the Hechinger Study. Through various initial difficulties, we were able to merge github branches without issue at the end of this project. We also practiced various techniques such as using local storage, calling APIs, html mapping, and css frameworking. Additionally, we worked with the CSS Framework Bulma, and Javascript modals.
